# Public Suffix List Go Tooling

This is a small Go module that contains tools used for the maintenance of the
Public Suffix List data.

If you are looking to consume the Public Suffix List from a Go application you
should instead use a library dedicated to this purpose such as
[/x/net/publicsuffix][x-pubsuf], or [publicsuffix-go][pubsuf-go].

[x-pubsuf]: https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/net/publicsuffix
[pubsuf-go]: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/weppos/publicsuffix-go
